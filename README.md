# Youtube Css for Fluent Theme.

### **Yes the home page automatically hides the navigation bar on the left. For it to appear you have to click on the hamburger menu button twice after which it will work as usual. I will make another css file where the hompage navigation menu doesnt hide automatically.**

### **You can find a preview of all the themes in [Preview.md](./Preview.md).**

## Notes:

*   **Does not work with Firefox because backdrop blur isnt supported.**
*   **Will be constantly editing**.
*   **This project is taken from a dropped stylish extentions theme called [APPLE-TUBE (BIG 2020 UPDATE)](https://userstyles.org/styles/175984/apple-tube-big-2020-update).**

## Installation and usage
You can use either Enhancer for Youtube Extension, Tweaks for YouTube Extension or any other such Extensions to apply this theme.
