Please notify if any issues found.

You can use either Enhancer for Youtube Extension or Tweaks for YouTube Extension to apply this theme.

All know option drawers have blurred background.

This project is taken from a dropped stylish extentions theme called APPLE-TUBE (BIG 2020 UPDATE)

I have removed several features such as color change to make the css as light on the ram as possible.

Blur backdrop does not work with Firefox.
