# Youtube Css for Fluent Theme.

### **You can find a preview of all the themes in [Preview.md](./Preview.md).**

### **Yes the home page automatically hides the navigation bar on the left. For it to appear you have to click on the hamburger menu button twice after which it will work as usual. I will make another css file where the hompage navigation menu doesnt hide automatically.**

## Notes:

*   **Does not work with Firefox because backdrop blur isnt supported.**
*   **Will be constantly editing**.
*   **If using the autohide nav theme theme please apply both css and javascript if you want to see the navigation menu when pressing the button.**
*   **If only css is used navigation menu will never appear even if clicked multiple times.**
*   **This project is taken from a dropped stylish extentions theme called [APPLE-TUBE (BIG 2020 UPDATE)](https://userstyles.org/styles/175984/apple-tube-big-2020-update).**

## Installation and usage
You can use either Enhancer for Youtube Extension, Tweaks for YouTube Extension or any other such Extensions to apply this theme.
Go to the custom css section of the extention and copy past all the contents of [theme.css](./theme.css)
